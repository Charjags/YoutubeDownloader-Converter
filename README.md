# YoutubeDownloader-Converter
Python tool designed to download individual YouTube videos, YouTube Playlists, and/or convert them to an mp3 file! For Education Purposes Only.
When a file is downloaded, it will automatically save into the projects folder. It will not work if you open it on the editor. You will need to open them from the files :)
